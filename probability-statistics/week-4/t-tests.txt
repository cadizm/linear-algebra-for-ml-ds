Consider again your sample
consisting of the heights of ten 18 year olds with
the mean 68.442 and the three sets of hypothesis that we
talked about in the previous videos. In the example from the previous videos,
you knew that you had ten samples and that the population standard
deviation was three. What this meant is that if zero is true,
then the sample mean distributes normally with a mean of 66.7 and a standard
deviation of 3 over square root 10. The difference now is that
you don't know sigma, which in turn affects
the distribution of the data. It's no longer this normal one over here,
so what can you do now? Well, if you remember
from the previous lesson, we introduced the t statistic which
was used in cases just like this one. The small drawback is that all the
computations will have to be made in terms of the t statistics rather
than the sample mean directly. So instead of plotting
the distributions around 66.7, you will need to draw them around zero. Under H0, this t statistic follows
a t distribution with nine degrees of freedom and this is corresponding PDF. The goal now is to repeat the three
tests using the t statistic instead. Let's begin by considering
the right tail test for the mean of the Gaussian
distribution with a known sigma. The data now is n = 10,
sample mean of 68.442 and we need to add the sample variance
which when we calculated is 3.113, the observed t statistic is then 1.71. To get the p value for this test,
you want the probability that the t statistic is greater than
1.771 given that H0 is true, this is the shaded area which
has a probability of 0.0552. Since this value is greater than 0.05,
you should not reject H0. This is the exact opposite result you
got from the right tail test when sigma was known. This has to do with the uncertainty added
from not knowing the sample variance. Suddenly, the evidence you had
was not enough to reject H0. Now let's repeat the process for
the two tail tests. The p value is now the probability
that the t statistic is an absolute value greater than your observed data. In this case, the observed statistic
is positive, so it's correct. In the general case, you would need to add
an absolute value in case the observed statistic is negative, you now need
to include the left tail because now you're looking at absolute values,
this gives the probability of 0.1103. Notice that once again this is double the
p value you had for the right tail test. This p value is greater than 0.5, so
the conclusion is again do not reject H0. And finally consider the left tail test,
so let's consider again that the sample you
had achieved has an average of 64.252. Also imagine that the sample standard
deviation remain the same and in this case the observed value for
the statistic is -2.487. In the case of a left tail test,
the p value is the probability that the t statistic is less than the observed
value -2.487 given that H0 is true, and that is this shaded area over here
which gives a probability of 0.0173. For this sample,
you obtain a p value smaller than 0.05, so the correct conclusion is
that you should reject H0 and accept the hypothesis that
the population mean has reduced.
