So far, all the hypothesis testing we've done has
been with one sample in one population. But what happens if we want to take
different samples in different populations? For example, let's say I have two
countries, and I believe that the people in this country are taller than those in
this country, but I can only take samples. Two-sample hypothesis testing is
going to tell us how to compare samples on different populations. In the following videos, you're going to
learn about comparing two populations. Consider for this example that you're
interested in comparing the heights of 18 year olds in the US with the heights
of 18 year olds in Argentina. For the first group,
you have 10 samples x 1 up to x 10, which with the values shown above, have an
observed sample mean of 68.42 inches and a sample standard deviation of 3.113. For the Argentinian group,
you have only 9 samples y 1 up to y 9, with an observed mean of 65.949 inches and a simple standard
deviation of 3.106 inches. Your goal is to determine if
the population mean from the US is different than the population
mean from Argentina. So, just as with sample test,
you can define three types of hypothesis. In all three cases, you will consider the null hypothesis
that both population means are the same. First, you can consider the alternate
hypothesis that the population mean of 18-year-olds in the US is
bigger than that in Argentina. You could also consider the alternative
hypothesis that the population mean in the US is smaller than that in Argentina. And finally, there's an alternative
hypothesis that both population means are simply different. Writing this hypothesis in terms of
the difference mu US minus mu Argentina, you get a right-tail test,
a left-tail test, and a two-tail test. Now let's use the following assumptions. The first one is that all people in the
sample from the two groups are different. That means that there is no one
measured that belongs to both groups. The second one is that each height
measurement from each person is independent from the other ones. The third one is that the populations for the height in both countries
are normally distributed. This means that all measurements X coming
from the US have a Gaussian distribution with mean Mu US and
a standard deviation Sigma US. And the same goes for
the samples coming from Argentina, which have a mean mu Argentina and
standard deviation sigma Argentina. You can then define the sample means for
each group. X bar will be the sample mean for
the US population and Y bar the one for Argentina. Another same question is
how the difference between both sample means distribute. Since it's a linear combination
of Gaussian variables, then it will also be a Gaussian,
but with which parameters? The mean will be the difference
of the population means, and the standard deviation will be the square
root of the variances of each sample mean. If you don't quite remember the result,
you can go back to Week Two, Lesson 1, where this result was explained. Of course, you can standardize
the difference between X bar and Y bar to get a statistic that has
a standard normal distribution. However, since we don't know
the population standard deviation from any of the two groups, then the best
we can do is to replace Sigma US and Sigma Argentina with the sample
standard deviation from each group. So that you have the statistics
given by X bar minus Y bar minus Mu US minus Mu Argentina
divided by the square root of Sx squared over 10
plus Sy squared over 9. This statistic also has a T distribution
because it corresponds to a statistic for the mean of a Gaussian population
with an unknown Sigma. Unfortunately, the formula for finding the
degrees of freedom is very cumbersome, but don't worry about it. A bunch of software packages
will do this for you. In this case, evaluating this awful expression
gives you 16.8 degrees of freedom. Replacing nx, ny, sx, and
xy by those served values, you actually get that
degree of freedom of 16.8. Now, after all that math, let's
briefly refresh the problem statement. You have two groups of samples. In this case, one correspond to ten
samples of heights of 18-year-olds in the US, and the other one to nine samples
of height of 18-year-olds from Argentina. From the US sample,
you observed a mean of 68.42 inches and a sample standard deviation of 3.113, while the Argentina sample has
an observed mean of 65.949 inches and a sample standard deviation of 3.106. Let's begin with a right-tail
test with null hypothesis Mu US minus Mu Argentina equals 0. An alternative hypothesis that Mu
us minus Mu Argentina is positive. This means that the population mean
from the US is greater than the one from Argentina. Also, let's consider
a significance value of 0.05. From last slide,
you know that if H 0 is true, then the statistic t equals X bar
minus Y bar divided by the square root of Sx squared divided by 10
plus Sy squared divided by 10. Where these sample variances has a T
distribution with 16.8 degrees of freedom. Replacing the absurd
values in the statistic, you get that the observed
statistic is 1.7459. But what's the p-value for this sample? Well, because it's a right-tail test,
the p-value is a probability under the null hypothesis that the statistic T
is greater than the observed statistic. This corresponds to this area under
the PDF and has a value of 0.0495. Since the p-value is smaller than
the significance level of 0.05, then the decision is to reject
the null hypothesis and to accept that the population mean in the
US is bigger than the one in Argentina. Now let's see what you can say
about the two-tailed tests. All sample values are the same, as is the
significance level and the test statistic. What changes now is how
you calculate the p-value. In this case, you want
the probability under H0 statistic is an absolute value greater
than the observed statistic, which is the sum of these two areas and
has a value of 0.0991. In this case, since the p-value is
greater than the significance level, you don't have enough evidence to project
the null hypothesis that the population means are the same.
